I think that a good way to implement this is to ask regulatory agencies to either propose two regs to cut every time they advance a new one or be prepared to vigorously defend every single regulation on their books. And if they can then fine, no cuts, but there are plenty of unnecessary and failed regs to be cut for quite a while. These things tend to have inertia, and will not be gotten rid of if it is not a procedural requirement.  I think that the job description of a regulator should not just be to write regulations, but also to remove regulations too.\n",

      "To clarify a few things â \n",
      "\n",
      "a.\tBy âwhite supremacistsâ, I donât mean âTrump supportersâ, I mean literal white supremacist, pro-ethnostate people advocating ethnic cleansing, lynching, etc. KKK, Neo-nazis, an unfortunately large portion of the alt-right, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "b.\tI think itâs important to at least engage in some form of debate, but if white supremacists arenât receptive to debate or are unwilling to critically examine evidence contrary to their position, then someone is justified in using violence against them to deny them a platform for his speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "c.\tI make a distinction between legality and morality. You can try to convince me otherwise, but I probably wonât be receptive to those arguments. \n",
      "\n",
      "d.\tIâm presupposing that excluding and being violent towards minorities is a bad thing. Donât try to argue otherwise, because youâre going to fail to change my view.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now to lay out the basis of my argumentation\n",
      "\n",
      "1.\tLiberal democracy has been historically exclusionary of minorities. It has a history of coercive expropriation, violence, racism, and exploitation. Consolidation of liberal democratic power was accompanied by concurrent expansion and intensification of colonial slavery, and despite the success of several liberal revolutions in countries such as France, America, and Britain, slavery persisted and in fact developed. The rise of liberalism and the spread of racial chattel slavery are the product of a twin birth.\n",
      "2.\tLiberal democracy is still exclusionary towards minorities â voter suppression, privatized slave labor in prisons, violent crackdown of any radically left groups such as the Black Panthers, murder of radicals such as MLK, colonialist expansion and puppet regimes such as Batistaâs Cuba or Pinochetâs Chile.\n",
      "3.\tLiberal democracy is built upon a paradox â a simultaneous invocation of liberty on the one hand, and a justification and promulgation on severe, unacceptable forms of oppression previously discussed on the other. Itâs founded on an implicit logic of exclusion, drawing a dividing line between âusâ and âthemâ, deciding who is worthy or capable (morally, intellectually, biologically, or racially) of rights or liberties.\n",
      "4.\tThis forms an intense pattern of structural violence which allows us to form personal in and out groups which allows us to exclude minorities from any sort of normative consideration, effectively making them âun-peopleâ.\n",
      "5.\tThus, in order to solve continued, systematic structural violence, two things must occur\n",
      "\n",
      "a.\tA removal of structural violence that normalizes and obscures violence against poor and minorities, by any means necessary to halt their exclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "b.\tA movement to a political system which doesnât perpetuate the same kinds of oppressive mindsets and violence against vulnerable people.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.\tThis necessitates an ethical obligation to fight Nazism and other repressive political ideologies, which at the very least creates permissibility to use violence, even though it runs counter to current liberal democratic political norms, which I view as illegitimate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, as a preempt to alternative methods being more effective, here is my position on why debate and civil disobedience against fascists and white supremacists is not only ineffectual, but also actively harmful to antifascist causes.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.\tSilence is consent. Nazi Germany found a rapid consolidation of power, stripping citizenship and civil rights from minorities and political opposition. Moderates âopposedâ Nazism but didnât do anything except further the legal framework used to orchestrate the genocide of the Jewish population. Even if youâre in favor of liberal democracies, they inevitably get perverted by far-right racist populists who can then enact laws that harm minorities â see Theresa May, Donald Trump, Boris Johnson, Jean-Marie Le Pen, etc. Even though theyâre not literal white supremacists who want to ethnically cleanse, the same tactics that got these guys elected are the ones who elected Hitler, Mussolini, and Konoye, and the like. And thatâs bad. If you arenât actively fighting dangerous anti-minority nationalism, youâre complicit in the extermination of minorities, and youâre morally culpable.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.\tWhite nationalists, white supremacists, Nazis, and Klanners wonât respond to reason or logic. Their ideologies arenât grounded in reason or logic. Their ideology is violence, so they only language they understand is violence. Donât get confused by their attempts to recruit others through persuasion or twisted facts â they donât give a damn if what theyâre saying is true or not, they just want to ensnare people. Thatâs why you can never âwinâ a debate against a fascist. Theyâre not interested in debating you, theyâre interested in making you look weak and ineffectual since youâre unwilling to do anything other than mince words with you. Thatâs why theyâre all a bunch of smug assholes. Because they want to put on an air of being superior.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.\tFighting Nazis doesnât make you a Nazi. One of my great grandparents killed Nazis as a member of the US Armed Forces, and he wasn't one. Another one of my great grandparents killed a Nazi escaping from Sobibor in 1943. He definitely wasnât a Nazi. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. When Nazis take power, it's already too late. The only way to quell white nationalism is to stamp it out before it takes power. Waiting for them to do bad things lets them *do* those bad things. And that's bad.\n",

      "We know that Russia was extremely interested in helping Donald Trump win the election.  They hacked the DNC, gave money to Paul Manafort, and ran propaganda aimed at denigrating Clinton.

      "\n",
      "The actual mechanism for pulling it off does not sound entirely implausible to me.  First off, only a few voting machines in key polling places in Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, or Florida would need to be affected to completely swing the election.  It seems entirely possible that a Russian agent could go into a polling booth, install the tampering device, and later another agent could go pick it up to remove the evidence.  We've seen how quickly and easily hard-to-detect credit card swipers can be installed.  And we know it can be done with [voting machines, too](http://fortune.com/2016/11/04/voting-machine-hack-watch-video-cylance/).\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I researched this before posting, and the one thing that keeps me from fully believing this is that most of the experts seemingly flat-out dismiss the idea that voting could have tampered with.  But, in my opinion, they are focusing on moot points in their arguments:\n",

      "Here are the arguments. The money's part on the argument is highlighted.  \n",
      "- Climate change: the world's weather is becoming weirder each year because the humanity has been destroying the natural habitats. All the recent years has been dubbed the \"hottest in history\". It's likely that the Middle East becomes uninhabitable in the next century because of the climate change. We could stimulate the society to pass through the necessary changes for the Earth to survive this \"virosis\" called humanity, but enterprises won't make their part because cleaner alternatives (e.g. solar/wind power versus coal/oil) are still **too expensive** to compete with their polluting, more commonly used counterparts. When the clean alternatives are competitive, it will probably be too late. I've heard that the planet could only safely become one/two degrees warmer, and it almost makes me want to have the ability to start a second Ice Age. The fact that the United States elected a climate change denier as their Head of Government doesn't help.  \n",
      "- Public belongings' management: we could have the private sector manage most stuff and leave to the government only the mission to protect the population, manage the country's diplomatic relations and make/discuss/implement laws and have them followed. But too much of the population (from most countries) is **too poor** to afford the private companies' services (e.g. in my country, the roads in a good state are usually private-owned and have tolls). Also, the government is necessary to give services (like mail) to people in the middle of nowhere because it's **not profitable** for the private enterprises.  \n",
      "- Social inequality: some of the problems brought by excessive social inequality are high crime rate, usually committed because of \"\"\"\"\"lack of opportunities and moral roles\"\"\"\"\"; and the richer people having too much influence, using their \"Cash Force\" to manipulate politicians.  \n",
      "There are other problems that I can't have too much detail like enterprises having their products made with semi-slave work (or even slave work) in less developed countries because \"**it reduces the cost**\", and bribing (why the hell is lobbying legal in the US?!).  \n",
      "P.S.: I got it, people. Money is not the problem, just the human nature.\n",

      "\n",
      "â¢ 2996 deaths on the day(along with family's grief caused directly by this).\n",
      "\n",
      "â¢ Many US citizens became fearful of planes and Muslims for a time. Also due to this, airline travel was used less for a while, leading to a slightly worse economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "â¢ Potentially the Iraq war only started because of 9/11 (I do not know enough about this and based on the little that I do know, it would have happened regardless).\n",
      "\n",
      "â¢ The patriot act was brought in by a frightened US and led to many oversteppings on privacy etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reasons I believe Trump's Inauguration is bad: (For this I have to of course be speculative)\n",
      "\n",
      "â¢ Trump's rise to power has given a voice to the violent and dangerous fringes of society like the KKK and has made racism and hate crimes against minorities appear slightly more reasonable by the ppl who support him. (I know 9/11 probably caused increased hate crimes too but surely not on this level).\n",
      "\n",
      "â¢ The immensely negative effects of having a world superpower led by a climate change denier flanked by Oil CEOs and other climate change deniers for 4 years. The effects of this will not be seen for years and years until mass migration is caused by global warming worsened by Trump.\n",
      "\n",
      "â¢ Under Trump, income inequality will almost certainly rise a lot which I believe to be a terrible thing. He will scrap Obamacare which, while far from perfect, was a good first step towards proper free healthcare for all.\n",
      "\n",
      "â¢ He will have a rly strict stance on immigration and ruin the lives of millions of potential immigrants.\n",
      "\n",
      "So in summary, once you factor out the Iraq war(which I think would have happened anyway based on what little understanding I have of it - it being due to the oil and already worsening relations there), I think that the rising income inequality, worsened global warming, increase in hate crimes, and strict immigration stance will have a worse effect on the US and the world as a whole than the 2996 deaths, the fears by some Americans of Muslims and planes for a while, and the patriot act.\n",

      "This opinion is a bit different than other CMVs because it applies to my personal situation, but nevertheless it's a view I believe in but people in r/personalfinance and r/investing disagree with.

      "I'm from the Netherlands, currently 19 y/o, in university, I've got a study that will last about 2,5 more years. I'm getting pretty much all my credits first try, I should have no issue finishing the study, I'm 1,5 years in. I'm not getting any loans, my parents pay for my study and I work for all other expenses. \n",
      "\n",
      "I can get about 800 euros per month of personnel loans, rent-free. I would be free to spend that loan on anything I like, most students waste it on beer and partying. If I were to get the loan and put it in the bank I would get some profit from it, about 0.03%. This would be nice, not only because of the 0.03%, but because it's a cheap loan. I have 30 years to pay it back after my study, which means I could use it as a very cheap mortgage when buying a house (I would still be able to get a mortgage, but it would be smaller). \n",
      "\n",
      "But I think there's more potential to that loan than simply putting it in the bank. I think I can invest it into ETFs to profit from it. For those that don't know, ETFs are basically funds that try to follow the market trend by simply buying a lot of shares from a LOT of different companies. It does not have too much risk, because it cant just crash to zero, unlike shares themselves. Of course, it's possible the whole market crashes (with another crisis), but it would still go gradually. I will sell the ETFs if I were to get 4000 euro losses. I understand this is quite the opposite of 'buy low sell high' but the odds of losing 4000 is very small but not too big of a problem, 4000 can be made back quite easily over the 30 years I have to pay it off. \n",

Even if I'm not putting it into the best ETFs (lowest cost), I should still have a higher expected returns than expected losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The expected returns are greater than the expected losses. A part of the returns are from investing, the other part is the cheaper mortgage. The maximum loss I can get with this plan is 4000 euros. Due to the nature of ETFs I can't really lose more than 4000, I will check the value of the ETFs daily. I'll keep loans and personal money strictly separate, and not spend any loans on other stuff.\n",

      "\n",
      "I am actually starting to doubt the value of contemporary protests since they echo out a radical minority that divides us further, often lead to riots and more anger with out positive actions.

I understand that not everyone knows how to or can afford to prepare healthy meals, and that high-calorie food is cheaper and often far more convenient than low-calorie food. I'm a 5'2\" woman, and my cooking abilities end with the microwave. Unless I go out to eat or my parents invite me over to have dinner (Which happens a lot) 98% of my food is cereal, wal-mart desserts, pizza, and fast food. BUT I know when to stop. If I eat 3 frozen chocolate pie slices I know that adds up to ~900 calories, so I can only eat ~400-500 more calories total that day. If that doesn't nourish me or makes me feel tired or hungry, too damn bad. I shouldn't have eaten three pies in a row. I don't often make very good choices. Sometimes I'm tired. Sometimes I'm hungry for 3 or 4 hours during the day. But I'm not fat. \n",
      "\n",
      "What I honestly think it comes down to is that overweight people just plain don't want to stop eating. They aren't physically dependent on their \"addiction\" to entire boxes of doughnuts. Not in the same way that an alcoholic or heroin addict is to their drug of choice. They just aren't willing to either buy more nourishing food, or go hungry some of the time. They should really just admit that rather than citing addiction, and stop pretending the choice is out of their hands because it isn't and it never has been.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet, if it really were as easy as \"force yourself to eat less come hell or high water\", wouldn't most people have done it already?\n",
      "Ostensibly, MMFR is post-apocalypse Australia, but I consider this to be an almost irrelevant assertion that has little to no bearing on what the film depicts. The story is essentially in the vein of Hero myths (only in a future/sci-fi milieu rather than a past/fantasy milieu) and is best understood in that context.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have several reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) despite ostensible scarcity of water, guzzoline, and bullets, the society depicts that the warlords have plentiful supplies and merely control access and trade. Moreover, there is profligate waste of these resources. The Honest Trailers review of the movie points out that *everyone* wastes water, and the methods of distributing it make no sense. My view is that it doesn't have to, it's not even intended to make rational sense. \n",
      "\n",
      "2) There is no identifiable geography that indicates the story takes place in the real world. There is no indication of how far in the future the story takes place, just as in past-oriented myths there is no indication of how long ago were the labors of Hercules or the Aboriginal Dreamtime.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Ostensibly, the old-model cars are the only ones still operational due to the collapse of the maintenance infrastructure that modern computerized cars depend on, but I don't buy it. It's one thing to have an obsolete gas-guzzler, but after massively increasing the weight by fusing two or three additional gas-guzzlers together, strapping on additional engines, turbochargers, etc, you'd be getting about six inches to the gallon, and that's before other absurdities such as spraying fuel directly into the air intakes and building flamethrowing guitars atop massive iron behemoths which serve no purpose except to provide thumping diegetic rock music to get your War Boyz pumped up.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) The characters themselves seem to be mythic caricatures. Immortan Joe, The People Eater, and The Bullet farmer are overtly monstrous (The latter is basically a blind half-tank machine-gun centaur by the end). They don't act like warlords managing armies and ruling kingdoms, they act like dragons who have had their hoards plundered by dwarves and hobbits. I think Joe's mask is designed to evoke an overtly dragon-like aspect. Likewise, Joe's Wives are angelic creatures by post-apocalyptic standards. Furiosa and Max are demigod heroes in comparison to the wretched state of Joe's serfs and the goblin-like War Boyz. The naming conventions are also larger-than-life: in addition to the warlords, names like The Splendid Angharad, Toast The Knowing, Cheedo The Fragile, The Organic Mechanic, Corpus Collossus, Rictus Erectus, The Valkyrie, and The Keeper of Seeds indicate that we're not dealing with ordinary people, we're dealing with mythic characters with specific attributes for their role in the story. \n",

      "This is an idea I had while watching a hockey game recently.   If a team receives a minor penalty in the final two minutes of a period, then I think the opposing team should be given the option to delay enforcement until the start of the next period.\n",

      "In theory, it would work like this:  1) A player on team A receives a 2-minute penalty for tripping.  There is currently 00:23 left in the first period.

I don't think this rule should apply for major penalties (5 mins).\n",

      "\n",
      "A lotta ppl bash TD for squashing dissent and criticism of Trump. But TD is trying to be a pro-Trump sub; it is not a Trump discussion or politically neutral sub. Additionally, they do not attempt to hide this. Rule VI on there, the message that appears when you hover over the submit button (\"Post Only If You Support Trump!\"), as well as the banner that appears under the comment box (\"Posts supporting other candidates will be removed\") should be enough to prove this. It's not a secret.\n",

And given that, they have full grounds to call out Spez and /r/news.

Primarily, it seems that the main argument that these users were arguing for Vegans to be valid points proved the hypocrisy of veganism.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. From the top comment by /u/Kevim_A:\n",
      "\n",
      "> A vegan will argue that the conditions a large portion of cows/chickens live in to produce milk/eggs are unethical. ... So, the moral argument of the vegan could be: \"I think the treatment of these animals is unethical, and I don't want to support an unethical industry. Hopefully my own and others with a vegan diet's lack of contribution to the market will eventually cause less demand, lesssened production, and therefore less animals in poor conditions.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the primary argument that was noticed, and repeated in the discussion. The main point of contention is that it is inhuman for the industrial raising / slaughter of these animals.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the contrary, the vegans will gladly purchase their items that are created in morally unethical sweat shops, whether the items be clothing, electronics (cell phones, video game consoles), and other pieces of consumer goods that are mass produced.\n",
      "\n",
      "The argument that it is immoral and antithetical to purchase (and support) these industries products' falls apart under scrutiny that the same vegan will purchase items that are created in sweat shops where people half-a-world away are struggling to afford to eat, or are being forced to work for pennies on the dollar for upwards of fourteen hours a day.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a vegan was really not supporting the meat / animal industry because of their stance on the morality of the treatment of the animals, than they should not support the electronics / clothing industries as well because of the treatment of workers. The simple premise that they are supporting these massive corporations who produce the clothes / electronics just shows the fact that they are taking a stand when they don't have a leg to support themselves on, morally speaking, as they are stating that the welfare of animals is more important than the welfare of their fellow human beings.\n",

      "\n",
      "Most wars and large scale conflicts today are not between countries, but from within, like insurgent groups or militant religious organizations. This is a problem because it places pressure on the host government's resources, diverts assets from assisting people in need, and destabilizes entire nations, which leads to greater pressures on the international community to step in(Afghanistan Invasion) or to send aid. \n",

      "Poverty/Food Insecurity\n",
      "\n",
      "These two things are together because they are intrinsically linked. A person's inability to find money or other equivalent prevents him from buying food. He is less able to work, more often hungry, more likely to become criminal, and generally not contributing to a country's overall well-being. \n",

      "\n",
      "The South China Sea Island dispute over who owns the islands in the South China Sea(hence the name) is one of several examples of peaceful(mostly) ongoing land disputes in the world. This is problematic because any provocative action taken here could destabilize the region, which is already not super balanced. While there is no present indication of this happening, the mere existence of a dispute suggests that sparks could fly eventually. \n",

      "War/Large Scale Conflict\n",
      "\n",
      "A World Government can mobilize a much larger, more comprehensive, effective fighting force to deal with groups that wish to cause others harm. The government's access to the world's resources makes this task easy. What would be a major concern is governance and control of this large force, as each former nation would surely hold old loyalties. \n",

      "Poverty/Food Insecurity\n",
      "\n",
      "There is enough food in the world to feed everyone. it is more about distribution. With a World Government, an agency can be created that subsidizes the cost of procuring an distributing food to places in need. But that is treating the symptoms, not the disease(strong language, but it fits the analogy). How a world government treats poverty is very difficult, because there really isn't a single solution. There needs to be large scale investment in infrastructure and security in parts of the world that do not have sufficient self-sustaining governments. How the world government would do this varies. Providing subsidies only goes so far. A world government would mostly be reliant on the charity of it's citizens to ensure this. Creation of low income jobs, like factory repetitive tasks, is no longer a viable option because of mechanized automation. So the first investment that a world government needs to do is in education. An investment in education is truly an investment in the future of that area.\n",

      "National Disagreements\n",
      "\n",
      "Depending on the circumstances of the creation of this world government, there may be some implementations more successful and others not so. The most successful implementations take into account the wealth of each nation, and the power being distributed according both to wealth and population(perhaps a bicameral legislature, like the American Congress)(keep the rich happy, so they don't revolt). This will probably be the hardest, as giving up sovereignty is something that is not taken to lightly.\n",

      "\n",
      "Division by existing geographic boundaries, taking into consideration culture and political past. These divisions would serve as districts from which Representatives would be sent to a Legislative branch. Bicameral, perhaps tricameral, to divide the powers further, because centering power is dangerous, especially on a large scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "A judicial system, which would mostly serve similarly to the American system. Of course, over time there would be modifications. \n",
      "\n",
      "The stickiest point is what kind of binding agreement to have. A constitution is to inflexible. Instead, have the legislature make all of the rulings, and have the center of power in the legislature instead of the executive branch to ensure dilution of power. Appeals of actions taken by the legislature can be heard by the judiciary. \n",
      "\n",
      "The military portion of governance would be controlled by the executive and legislative branch jointly. This is to ensure that no one man/group of men can control the military power. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ensuring checks and balances and a fair and transparent system will be difficult. To do this, I propose the creation of a fourth branch of government, an Ethics branch, if you please. This branch would have wide-reaching powers to regulate which powers each portion of government possess, the exception being itself. The ethics branch would be led by another representatively elected body, smaller than the Legislature, but large and powerful enough to provide a legal defense against a coup(perhaps not a military one).\n",

      "Let's say there is a father and son. For whatever reason, the father restricts the son from giving money to charities or to any charitable cause for his entire upbringing. Years later, they have a falling out and the son donates a large sum of money to a charity. He doesn't care about the charity or its recipients one bit and is doing this to spite his father. I believe that that still makes the son a good person as the mental state shouldn't have precedence over the real world results.\n",

      "2. It's reverse discrimination. You cannot fix past discriminations with more discrimination, all people are equal under the laws of the United States and should be treated equally. It wasn't fair or right when white men were favored in the past, it isn't fair to favor minorities and women now. Employers should be blind to race and discrimination when choosing employees. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. Having people of different races or ethnicities does not necessarily mean diversity of opinion. \n",
      "There's a romance in the american mythology that every vote should count. To get to that point, it is assumed that the american electorate is capable and informed. By blaming fake news, we are acknowledging that the electorate is incapable and easily misinformed. This is incompatible with the belief that the american people know best. To be clear, i want people to take as a given that the american people do know best. I don't entirely believe that, but it is taken as a given in enough situations to warrant wondering about the implications if true.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, I'd like you to change this opinion: if I believe that the american electorate is ultimately capable of governing itself, fake news shouldn't concern me because the electorate should be able to rise above it and shouldn't need to have its hand held or its mouth censored. \n",
      "\n",
      "A consequence of this is that there shouldn't need to be a police what news is delivered to people. For example, facebook shouldn't have to be more conscious about its role as a steward of information. It shouldn't even consider itself as a steward of news for the fact that alternative sources of good information are available and easily accessible. It should be very clear that facebook is not the only source of information. For example, people are able to look up the emails or search for whether or not something had been definitely proven as opposed to insinuated. So ultimately, in this case, because people are capable, they should be able to access those better sources of information. In other words, it's mostly their fault for seeing the equivalent of an ad, and buying into the messaging because it flatters their ideology and prior beliefs. \n",

      "One argument that is commonly asserted as evidence against the legalization of gay marriage is the idea that the legalization of gay marriage will lead to the legalization of polygamy.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not true.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a few secluded instances of polygamy in the United States. Most notable are the efforts of the Latter Day Saints to arrange so called \"placement marriages\". However, in an 1890 manifesto, the LDS President Willford Woodruff issued a statement marking the policy of plural marriage of any kind is against \"[God's standard](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/od/1?lang=eng)\".\n",
      "\n",
      "In the 2015 Supreme Court ruling on *Obergefell v Hodges* which effectively legalized gay marriage nationwide^1, none of the dissenting judge's opinions where about the issue of polygamy as a result of legalization, except for Chief Justice Robert's dissenting opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roberts says in his dissent that much of the argument for gay marriage would \"[apply with equal force](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf)\" to polygamous marriage. He further expands on this by arguing that for the same reason that gay's should have the right to marry because of \"stigma\", that right should be extended to polygamy for the same reason. \n",
      "\n",
      "A large amount of the stigma associated with gay marriage and polygamous marriage is religiously oriented. Associating the two is a very religious-centric idea. Roberts is a devout Roman Catholic, and this is his expression of his religious ideals, an idea that is shared by fellow devotees, *but not* with those who advance the gay marriage agenda. \n",

      "\n",
      "To add on to what I said earlier, and to respond to some concepts posed in the comments, it is my belief that another part of religious opposition to gay marriage and polygamous marriage is the idea of love, and more broadly love can only be between one and another, like Adam and Eve(though I am unclear as to whether they married or not, or loved wach other for that matter. I just want this example to show that there exists a biblical basis for the idea of one-person-love, or that you can only love one other person in an intimate sense).\n",

      "Christianity promises unbelievers hell, a life of eternal agony after death. Islam and Judaism promise the same. However, I don't believe that this is a just punishment for two reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reason #1 - EDIT: Nobody has responded to this one yet, I'm interesting in reading some responses. Most replies have been about reason 2\n",
      "\n",
      "Belief is almost wholly a result of nurture, and the method of nurture seems to be *heavily* dependent on geographic location. If I am born in Somalia, there's a >99% chance that I am a Muslim. If the Christian or Jewish God is the true God, that's a big problem; despite the fact that I have no choice over where I am born, the likelihood that I come to faith in the true religion is much less than if I were born in, say, Mississippi for Christianity or Israel for Judaism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reason #2 is that it seems to me that people are only \"sinners\" because of the way they were biologically created. If I was created to desire perfect obedience to the Ten Commandments, then I would do that. But if I'm born to desire forbidden things, and all people that are only human have indulged in such desires, then sin is not the fault of the people but the fault of the creator.\n",
      "I'd like to just apologize in advance if this topic has been done before, but from what I could see only topics similar to this or branching off this have been done recently.\n",
      "\n",
      "So firstly, I'd like to note that I am not including survival and hunting-in-the-wild situations where it would be required. I'm talking almost specifically about situations in which people have available resources and income; some people's situations (homeless, those in third-world countries, etc.) would make it extremely difficult.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I'll start addressing the usual nutritional arguments people come up with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Protein is very easy to get without meat because protein is virtually in every food, even if it may be in smaller doses. It doesn't matter if the nine essential amino acids have to come from different sources as it can be just as easy as getting from two foods options vs. one. In fact, in a cultural sense, it already happens: beans & rice, peanut butter and bread, or basically any legume along with any grain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Iron is also easy to get if you eat the right foods: oats, beans, cereal. Admittedly, non-heme iron (plant iron) is absorbed at a lower rate than heme iron (animal iron) but it is absorbed nonetheless, and there is another solution if absorption is a problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vitamin C, which can be found in citrus fruits or tomatoes, can boost iron absorption by up to 5 times! So even if by default vegetarians have a lower absorption rate of iron, they can easily get the minimum (or more) amount of required iron by have orange juice with oatmeal or salsa with beans. Notice this already happens culturally like with protein.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the main arguments against living without meat would be the lack of B12 which is completely true, but pills are readily available for vegans, and vegetarians can get enough if they eat enough eggs, dairy, fortified cereal, or fortified drinks. Some meat-eaters even need to supplement with a pill.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are more nutrients to mention, but the only other one I find worth noting is Omega 3. Most vegetarians/vegans will go straight to saying how you can eat walnuts or flax rather than fish to get Omega 3, which is true. Most would respond those are poor sources because they are ALA which has to become DHA/EPA. You get the Omega 3 either way, but if you are worried about your Omega 3 to Omega 6 ratio, because having Omega 6 in your system makes the ALA to DHA/EPA conversion slower (whole other thing I'm not gonna get into) you can opt for DHA/EPA Omega 3 from algae which can come in pill form.\n",
      "\n",
      "I could go on and talk about how you don't need dairy either but that's another argument.\n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT: To be clear, you have to make sure you get the right amount of calories too (eat enough) as you can't get by on just bread or salad. Also you don't need creatine, taurine, or beta-alanine but you can supplement them if you want.\n",

This is not a new question--it was a large (but to me, unsatisfying) segment of the previously-mentioned philosophy class--but I've never gotten an answer I'm happy with. Basically, if God is omniscient, omnipotent, and omni-benevolent, how can evil exist? He should know about evil, be able to stop evil, and want to stop evil. He can be any two of the three, but not all three.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most common answer I've heard is that free will allows for evil, but also allows for a greater good than could exist without free will. This seems pretty implausible to me; if God is all-powerful, why can't he create those goods? Even if he can't because it's somehow an oxymoron (the \"God can't create a burrito so big he can't eat it\" argument), why wouldn't God create humans to be predisposed to do good rather than evil? Instead, we have all these instincts--tribalism, selfishness, greed--that we have to fight if we want to act morally.\n",
      "\n",
      "But even setting that aside, what about evil that exists independent of human action? Even if we can put genocide down to free will, what about tsunamis? How is a tsunami part of God's loving plan? People say that bad things happen so greater good things can come, but for some people, they don't. If you die in an earthquake, there's no good coming after that (heaven, but you'll get there eventually anyway, so why the earthquake?)\n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, if God showed up in my bedroom today, I'd have a massive bone to pick with him about all the suffering in the world. Why do reasonable people think he's real, not to mention comforting?\n",

I just seems from my experience that a lot of people jump into college, and into huge mounds of debt, and then never end up actually applying their degree anyway -- when they would have benefited far more from going into the labor force.

      "My brother was showing me a list of policies he would like to enact if he was ever elected prime minister (we're Canadian). There were some I agree with, many that I disagreed with, but one in particular caught my eye: he wanted to make it a criminal offence to burn the flag. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was made very clear to me while reading through that he was very focused on culture and unity. He wanted to make radio stations play a minimum 30% Canadian artists and a maximum of 50% American artists, and put up more Canadian flags. To just quickly comment on these two, the former I see as a completely useless infringement of the free market, radio stations should be able to play what they want, there's still going to be stations playing mainly Canadian music and if people really care about that, those stations will flourish. The latter I don't care much, I doubt it'll cost that much in tax dollars as long as we don't put them on every damn street corner, so why not flaunt our pretty flag? Feel welcome to comment on these points but know that it's not the main point I'll be making. \n",
      "\n",
      "His argument for making burning the flag illegal, as he said, was that it is essentially an act of treason and undermines our cultural identity. It's completely immoral to burn the flag and we can't allow people to do so because all it does is damage and insult our culture, which makes us unique in the world. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don't agree with burning the flag. Canada is one of the best countries on earth, even when you compare it to the rest of the developed world. I know so few people who think this country is bad and if I saw anybody in person burning the flag I would think they're a privileged idiot who doesn't understand how great this place is and how lucky we are. And I'm a patriotic person, I always stand up and sing the national anthem at hockey games (eh?), I'll always wear a Canadian flag pin on my backpack when going traveling, but this country isn't what defines me. There's a reason people here don't complain much anymore about the lack of Canadian identity, because I think they, like me, realized that tolerance and individual freedom are much more important. I like the idea of a culture - it's fun to learn about and partake in, but still, I am my own person and you are your own person and whether you are Canadian or American or black or white or male or female, while those factors can have an influence on your person, you are still your own unique person. You should never see yourself as an actor in a political society or a culture, you should see yourself as an individual with the right to do anything as long as it doesn't hurt others (within reason, you shouldn't be able to not wear a seatbelt or jaywalk imo)\n",
      "\n",
      "So that explains why I don't care much about culture. I care about individual liberty over it. As such, people should be able to burn the flag as an act of expression as long as those flames don't cause a fire and hurt anybody or the area around them. If we care about freedom of speech this should certainly be allowed, especially if we allow people to speak discriminatory things about people, as long as it doesn't incite violence (which Canada does). \n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, this isn't something the government should have a moral stance on. The role of the government shouldn't be to implement the values and beliefs of the people in power but just to provide a rule of law and an effective national defence to protect its citizens from foreign and domestic threats, and to provide a basic social safety net to help people who are less fortunate. I understand that there are values wound up in those  roles, but what they do is provide a basic responsibility of the government and that is to protect its citizens so people have the freedom and ability to choose their life path and do as they wish.    There's a solid case for abortion being immoral. I don't agree, but even if I did, I would likely still be in favour of it being legal because I understand that my morals are not law and I shouldn't be telling others what to do. \n",
      "\n",
      "If one can't make a solid argument for a certain policy benefiting the lives of individuals and protecting them, usually I can't find myself agreeing with it. And criminalizing flag burning seems to just put a dent in our freedom of expression without adding any kind of benefit to our lives. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think I got everything. Thoughts?\n",
      "This is the only way I can say this without coming across as a bigot. There are people in this world who are undeniably better than me in multiple ways. Stronger. Smarter. More efficient. I will *never* be equal to them no matter what I do. I can certainly improve myself and strive for progress but it likely won't grant me the same level of success and adoration others have achieved *because I am not equal to them*. Personally, I believe it has to do with genetics. Perhaps some people are simply unlucky and wind up with faulty genetic compositions. I insist this has nothing to do with race or heritage and more to do with intelligence, capability, and adaptability. I think some people just happen to win the genetic lottery, and others have to put in a bit more effort to make it through life.\n",
