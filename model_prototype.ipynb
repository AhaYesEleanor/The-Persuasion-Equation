       " 'text': \"First of all, most definitions of prejudice define it as a preconceived notion of something (IE an assumption). Making assumptions was an evolutionary must, as an animal's (And a human's) brain is unable to process and understand every piece of information the senses give it at the same time as making rational decisions about it. Thus, the brain 'fills in the blanks' by rationally guessing facts and evidence. This way, the brain is able to concentrate on more important matters. \\n\\nFor example, primitive humans had to make split second decisions on threats in order to survive. A pair of eyes hiding in the bushes could signify a friend, but the brain assumes that it is an enemy, in order to protect itself. As humans spread, animal threats became less of an issue, but other human tribes became a bigger threat. Thus, now, the human has to make assumptions about other humans based on experience or social experience (The spreading of news and facts throughout a tribe). These assumptions build up to become prejudices that the human applies to all encounters. \\n\\nThese prejudices help the human survive; without it, he will be taken by surprise by any attack. These prejudices help us today too. Making generalized assumptions based on experience or social experience help us make decisions today. Take skin colour for example. If a man is deceived has his life savings stolen by a white man, he will automatically treat all other white men in the future with disdain. Say someone else gives away his money to a Nigerian prince, while being promised great reward, only to receive nothing. He will certainly not make the mistake of trusting a person of Nigerian origin ever again. \\n\\nThese prejudices help us function. Without them, we are likely to make mistakes based on statistical probability. Even if these mistakes are of our own fault (For example, a scam), the prejudice gained by the experience makes us more resilient against other attacks, and thus, improves us. \\n\\nHowever, I do understand that such prejudices overall make a world a worse place (If everyone hated everyone else, well...). I am arguing that prejudices are necessary. A poison that protects us from the hidden viper; It may make me a worse person, but at least I won't be hurt. \\n\\nChange my view, reddit! \\n\\nEDIT: Can people stop downvoting all of my comments? I'm trying to get my view changed here, not get downvoted to oblivion! \\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators. We'd like to remind you of a couple of things.

I do not want this first part \"If I believe that abortion, even in the first trimester is the same as killing another human being without their consent\" to be the point of this CMV, which is why I phrased it in this way.  As for whether I should be for or against abortion, I do know that in some circumstances, such as the death penalty or ending the life of someone on life support (edit: where the individual is unconscious and there is no stipulation in his will about such a situation), it is considered lawful (in most countries for life support and some for death penalty) to end someones life without their consent. Since that president is set, it is possible that abortions can be justified if the benefit of an abortion is large enough (Also because a fetus can technically be considered under life support). I believe that the benefit of aborting an unplanned child (Societal judgement, 18 years of an extra mouth to feedhouseetc, potential loss of employment amongst others) is large enough that abortions can be socially and lawfully accepted even if it is considered \"murder\" or ending a life of another human being without their consent.   For my view to be changed, my argument has to either be demolished, or other situationsexamples which are similar in nature to abortions, and are socially unacceptable, could be provided which would convince me that this form of \"ending someones life without their consent\" should not be accepted.
